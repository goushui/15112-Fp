Description

    Name: Tenko Survivor

	The player controls a character and around on a map. A boss will spawn with a health bar. The player has a laser gun to kill the boss. If the player kills the boss, they get to choose a set of upgrades for the character. The boss also gets more health and faster every time it respawns. Then, after a few seconds a new boss will spawn and after killing that boss, the player will select new upgrades to build upon the current upgrades. The cycle continues until the player dies. The player has a health bar that depletes when the boss attacks the player. The default attack is when the boss touches the player. The final score is the number of bosses that the player kills.
